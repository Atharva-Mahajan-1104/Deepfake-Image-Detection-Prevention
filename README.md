## 📌 Overview

Deepfake technology has significantly blurred the line between real and manipulated media. This project aims to **detect and prevent deepfake images** using **machine learning and neural network-based approaches**.

The system analyzes uploaded images and determines whether they are **authentic or artificially altered**. Along with the prediction, the model provides an explanation to help users understand the reasoning behind the result. The project also includes a **web-based interface built with Streamlit**, making the solution easy to use and accessible.

This repository is suitable for:

* Students exploring AI and image processing
* Developers interested in deepfake detection
* Researchers studying digital misinformation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Streamlit
* Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

---

### ▶️ Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd deepfake-detection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open the Web Interface**

   * The application will automatically open in your default browser.

---

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. Upload an image through the web interface
2. The model processes the image using trained neural networks
3. The system classifies the image as:

   * ✅ **Real**
   * ❌ **Deepfake**
4. An explanation is provided to justify the prediction

---

## 📊 Results

* The UI displays the project objective upon launch
* Users can upload test images for analysis
* The model returns:

  * Prediction result (Real / Fake)
  * Reasoning behind the classification

This makes the system intuitive and suitable for real-time verification.
